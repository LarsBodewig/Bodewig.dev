                    Welcome to my personal website. My name is Lars Bodewig. I
                    am a Software Developer from Germany.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started developing in 2014 and have been developing in a
                    corporate environment continuously since 2017. My complete
                    CV is available on

                    >.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within that time I gained experience in working in different
                    teams, technology stacks, programming languages and
                    products. My biggest strengths are

                    {% include 'badge', label: 'SQL' %}.<br>

                    -%}
                    {%- assign portfolioUrl = portfolio[0].url | url -%}
                    I am most efficient in Backend or Full Stack Development,
                    but also interested in Pipeline Engineering, Library
                    Development and Language Parsing. My

                    features a selection of projects showcasing my skills.
